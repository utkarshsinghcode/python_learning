# new code
#division of two numbers

num1 = 25
num2 = 4

divide_result = 25/4    # (/ divide always provide floating value)

print(divide_result) 

    #NEW CODE 

#divide and multiply

solve = 10/5*6
print(solve)    #(python first goes with divide give 2.0 .
                #( and then goes for multiply 2.0*6=12.0)

        #NEW CODE#
# volume of cube

length = 5
volume_of_cube = length**3   #volume of cube is a**3.

print(volume_of_cube)

   # NEW CODE #
# Problem = pens dividing in student

pen_nums = int(14)
students_nums = 3   # have to divide equally

# the nums of pen each student will get.

result = int(pen_nums/3) 
print("Pens for each student:",result)

# nums of pens left

left = pen_nums%3
print("Remaining pens:",left)
